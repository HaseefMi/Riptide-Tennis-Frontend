            <p>Riptide Table Tennis was founded in March 2022 by a team of dedicated high school students, 
                aiming to grow the popularity of Table Tennis and inspire others to play. As the only independent 
                organization hosting inter-school competitions in Ontario, weâ€™re expanding our reach across 
                the province. We currently host weekly events in Oakville and Scarborough, providing students 
                with a friendly, stress-free environment to compete.</p>
